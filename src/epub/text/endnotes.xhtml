					<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Woods, for example, in his edition of the first book (published in 1873) gives a list of readings for the first and second books, in which he almost invariably prefers the authority of Gronovius to that of Stein, where their reports differ. In so doing he is wrong in all cases (I think) except one, namely <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span>. 134 <span xml:lang="grc">τῷ λεγομένῳ</span>. He is wrong, for examine, in <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span>. 189, where the <abbr>MS.</abbr> has <span xml:lang="grc">τοῦτο</span>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span>. 196 <span xml:lang="grc">ἂν ἄγεσθαι</span>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span>. 199 <span xml:lang="grc">ὁδῶν</span>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span>. 15 <span xml:lang="grc">τῇ δὴ</span>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span>. 95 <span xml:lang="grc">ὑπ' αὐτò</span>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span>. 103 <span xml:lang="grc">καì προσηώτατα</span>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span>. 124 <span xml:lang="grc">τῷ ἄλλῳ</span> (without <span xml:lang="grc">λαῷ</span>), <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span>. 181 <span xml:lang="grc">υῷ</span>. Abicht also has made several inaccurate statements, <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">e.g.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span>. 185, where the <abbr>MS.</abbr> has <span xml:lang="grc">ἑς τòν Εὐφπήτην</span>, and <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VII</span>. 133 <span xml:lang="grc">Ξέρξης</span>. <a href="preface.xhtml#noteref-3" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>For example in the index of proper names attached to Stein’s annotated edition (Berlin, 1882), to which I am under obligation, having checked my own by it, I find that I have marked upwards of two hundred mistakes or oversights: no doubt I have been saved by it from at least as many. <a href="preface.xhtml#noteref-3" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

				<p>1 <span xml:lang="grc">Ἡροδότον Ἁλικαρνησσέος ἀπόδεξις ἥδε, ὡς κ.τ.λ.</span> The meaning of the word <span xml:lang="grc">ἱστορίη</span> passes gradually from “research” or “inquiry” to “narrative,” “history”; cp. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VII</span>. 96. Aristotle in quoting these words writes <span xml:lang="grc">Θονρίου</span> for <span xml:lang="grc">Ἁλικαρνησσέος</span> (“Herodotus of Thurii”), and we know from Plutarch that this reading existed in his time as a variation.]</p>
				<p>2 Probably <span xml:lang="grc">ἐργα</span> may here mean enduring monuments like the pyramids and the works at Samos, cp. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span>. 93, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span>. 35, <abbr>etc.</abbr>; in that case <span xml:lang="grc">τά τε ἀλλα</span> refers back to <span xml:lang="grc">τὰ γενόμενα</span>, though the verb <span xml:lang="grc">ἐπολέμησαν</span> derives its subject from the mention of Hellenes and Barbarians in the preceding clause.</p>
				<p>3 Many Editors have “with the Phenicians,” on the authority of some inferior <abbr>MSS.</abbr> and of the Aldine edition.</p>
				<p>4 <span xml:lang="grc">ἁρπαγῆς</span>.</p>
				<p>401 “thus or in some other particular way.”</p>
				<p>5 <span xml:lang="grc">Συρίων</span>, see ch. 72. Herodotus perhaps meant to distinguish <span xml:lang="grc">Σύριοι</span> from <span xml:lang="grc">Σύροι</span>, and to use the first name for the Cappadokians and the second for the people of Palestine, cp. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span>. 104; but they are naturally confused in the <abbr>MSS.</abbr></p>
				<p>6 <span xml:lang="grc">ἐξ ἐπιδρομῆς ἁρπαγή</span>.</p>
				<p>7 <span xml:lang="grc">τῆς ἀνοιγομένης θύρης</span>, “the door that is opened.”</p>
				<p>8 Or “because she was ashamed.”</p>
				<p>9 <span xml:lang="grc">Φοιτᾶν</span>.</p>
				<p>10 <span xml:lang="grc">ὑπεισδὺς</span>: Stein adopts the conjecture <span xml:lang="grc">ὑπεκδὺς</span>, “slipping out of his hiding-place.”</p>
				<p>11 This last sentence is by many regarded as an interpolation. The line referred to is <span xml:lang="grc">Οὔ μοι τὰ Γύγεω τοῦ πολυχρύσου μέλει</span>.</p>
				<p>12 See <span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span>. 92.</p>
				<p>13 <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr> like other kings of Lydia who came after him.</p>
				<p>14 <span xml:lang="grc">Κολοφῶνος τὸ ἀστυ</span>, as opposed apparently to the acropolis, cp. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VIII</span>. 51.</p>
				<p>15 See ch. 73.</p>
				<p>16 <span xml:lang="grc">ὁ καὶ ἐσβάλλων τηνικαῦτα ἐς τὴν Μιλησίην τὴυ στρατιήν</span>: an allusion apparently to the invasions of the Milesian land at harvest time, which are described above. All the operations mentioned in the last chapter have been loosely described to Alyattes, and a correction is here added to inform the reader that they belong equally to his father. It will hardly mend matters much if we take <span xml:lang="grc">ὁ Αυδός</span> in ch. 17 to include both father and son.</p>
				<p>17 <span xml:lang="grc">διδάξαντα</span>.</p>
				<p>18 This name is applied by Herodotus to the southern part of the peninsula only.</p>
				<p>19 Tarentum.</p>
				<p>20 <span xml:lang="grc">ἐν τοῖσι ἑσωλίοισι</span>: properly “benches,” but probably here the raised deck at the stern.</p>
				<p>21 {ou mega}: many of the <abbr>MSS.</abbr> have {mega}.</p>
				<p>22 {stadioi}: furlongs of about 606 English feet.</p>
				<p>23 {to epilogo}.</p>
				<p>24 This list of nations is by some suspected as an interpolation; see Stein’s note on the passage.</p>
				<p>25 {sophistai}: cp. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span>. 49, and <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span>. 95.</p>
				<p>26 {etheto}.</p>
				<p>27 {olbiotaton}.</p>
				<p>28 {stadious}.</p>
				<p>29 {romen}: many of the <abbr>MSS.</abbr> have {gnomen}, “good disposition.”</p>
				<p>30 <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr> their mother: but some understand it to mean the goddess.</p>
				<p>31 {en telei touto eskhonto}.</p>
				<p>32 {anolbioi}.</p>
				<p>33 {eutukhees}.</p>
				<p>34 {aperos}: the <abbr>MSS.</abbr> have {apeiros}.</p>
				<p>35 {aikhme sideree blethenta}.</p>
				<p>36 “in the house of Croesus.”</p>
				<p>37 {‘Epistion}.</p>
				<p>38 {‘Etaireion}.</p>
				<p>39 {suggrapsamenous}, <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr> have it written down by the {propsetes} (see <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VII</span>. 111 and <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VIII</span>. 37), who interpreted and put into regular verse the inspired utterances of the prophetess {promantis}.</p>
				<p>40 {es to megaron}.</p>
				<p>41 {oida d’ ego}: oracles often have a word of connection such as {de} or {alla} at the beginning (cp. ch. 55, 174, <abbr>etc.</abbr>), which may indicate that they are part of a larger connected utterance.</p>
				<p>42 Cp. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VII</span>. 178 and <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IX</span>. 91 (“I accept the omen.”)</p>
				<p>43 See <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VIII</span>. 134.</p>
				<p>44 {kai touton}, <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr> Amphiaraos: many Editors retain the readings of the Aldine edition, {kai touto}, “that in this too he had found a true Oracle.”</p>
				<p>45 {emiplinthia}, the plinth being supposed to be square.</p>
				<p>46 {exapalaiota}, the palm being about three inches, cp. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span>. 149.</p>
				<p>47 {apephthou khrusou}, “refined gold.”</p>
				<p>48 {triton emitalanton}: the <abbr>MSS.</abbr> have {tria emitalanta}, which has been corrected partly on the authority of Valla’s translation.</p>
				<p>49 “white gold.”</p>
				<p>50 Arranged evidently in stages, of which the highest consisted of the 4 half-plinths of pure gold, the second of 15 half-plinths, the third of 35, the fourth of 63, making 117 in all: see Stein’s note.</p>
				<p>51 {elkon stathmon einaton emitalanton kai eti duodeka mneas}. The {mnea} (mina) is 15.2 <abbr>oz.</abbr>., and 60 of them go to a talent.</p>
				<p>52 {epi tou proneiou tes gonies}, cp. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VIII</span>. 122: the use of {epi} seems to suggest some kind of raised cornerstone upon which the offerings stood.</p>
				<p>53 The {amphoreus} is about 9 gallons.</p>
				<p>54 Cp. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span>. 41.</p>
				<p>55 {perirranteria}.</p>
				<p>56 {kheumata}, which some translate “jugs” or “bowls.”</p>
				<p>57 {umin}, as if both Oracles were being addressed together.</p>
				<p>58 <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr> Delphi.</p>
				<p>59 {enephoreeto}, “he filled himself with it.”</p>
				<p>60 {Krestona}: Niebuhr would read {Krotona} (Croton or Cortona in Etruria), partly on the authority of Dionysius: see Stein’s note. Two of the best <abbr>MSS.</abbr> are defective in this part of the book.</p>
				<p>61 See <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span>. 51 and <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VI</span>. 137.</p>
				<p>62 {auxetai es plethos ton ethneon pollon}: “has increased to a multitude of its races, which are many.” Stein and Abicht both venture to adopt the conjecture {Pelasgon} for {pollon}, “Pelasgians especially being added to them, and also many other Barbarian nations.”</p>
				<p>6201 {pros de on emoige dokeei}: the <abbr>MSS.</abbr> have {emoi te}. Some Editors read {os de on} (Stein {prosthe de on}) for {pros de on}. This whole passage is probably in some way corrupt, but it can hardly be successfully emended.</p>
				<p>63 <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr> as it is of the Hellenic race before it parted from the Pelasgian and ceased to be Barbarian.</p>
				<p>64 {katekhomenon te kai diespasmenon⁠ ⁠… upo Peisistratou}. Peisistratos was in part at least the cause of the divisions.</p>
				<p>65 {paralon}.</p>
				<p>66 {uperakrion}.</p>
				<p>67 {toutous}: some read by conjecture {triekosious}, “three hundred,” the number which he actually had according to Polyænus, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span>. 21.</p>
				<p>68 {doruphoroi}, the usual word for a bodyguard.</p>
				<p>69 {perielaunomenos de te stasi}: Stein says “harassed by attacks of his own party,” but the passage to which he refers in ch. 61, {katallasseto ten ekhthren toisi stasiotesi}, may be referred to in the quarrel made with his party by Megacles when he joined Peisistratos.</p>
				<p>70 More literally, “since from ancient time the Hellenic race had been marked off from the Barbarians as being more skilful and more freed from foolish simplicity, (and) since at that time among the Athenians, who are accounted the first of the Hellenes in ability, these men devised a trick as follows.”</p>
				<p>71 The cubit is reckoned as 24 fingerbreadths, <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr> about 18 inches.</p>
				<p>72 So Rawlinson.</p>
				<p>73 See <span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span>. 70.</p>
				<p>74 {dia endekatou eteos}. Not quite the same as {dia evdeka eteon} (“after an interval of eleven years”); rather “in the eleventh year” (<abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr> “after an interval of ten years”).</p>
				<p>75 {thein pompe khreomenos}.</p>
				<p>76 For {‘Akarnan} it has been suggested to read {‘Akharneus}, because this man is referred to as an Athenian by various writers. However Acarnanians were celebrated for prophetic power, and he might be called an Athenian as resident with Peisistratos at Athens.</p>
				<p>77 Or “for that part of the land from which the temple could be seen,” but cp. Thuc. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span>. 104. In either case the meaning is the same.</p>
				<p>7701 {enomotias kai triekadas kai sussitia}. The {enomotia} was the primary division of the Spartan army: of the {triekas} nothing is known for certain.</p>
				<p>78 {kibdelo}, properly “counterfeit”: cp. ch. 75.</p>
				<p>79 {skhoino diametresamenoi}: whether actually, for the purpose of distributing the work among them, or because the rope which fastened them together lay on the ground like a measuring-tape, is left uncertain.</p>
				<p>80 Cp. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IX</span>. 70.</p>
				<p>81 {epitarrothos}. Elsewhere (that is in Homer) the word always means “helper,” and Stein translates it so here, “thou shalt be protector and patron of Tegea” (in the place of Orestes). <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Woods explains it by the parallel of such phrases as {Danaoisi makhes epitarrothoi}, to mean “thou shalt be a helper (of the Lacedemonians) in the matter of Tegea,” but this perhaps would be a form of address too personal to the envoy, who is usually addressed in the second person, but only as representative of those who sent him. The conjectural reading {epitarrothon exeis}, “thou shalt have him as a helper against Tegea,” is tempting.</p>
				<p>82 {agathoergon}.</p>
				<p>83 This was to enable him the better to gain his ends at Tegea.</p>
				<p>84 Cp. ch. 51, note.</p>
				<p>85 See ch. 6.</p>
				<p>86 {euzono andri}: cp. ch. 104 and <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span>. 34. The word {euzonos} is used of light-armed troops; Hesychius says, {euzonos, me ekhon phortion}.</p>
				<p>87 {orgen ouk akros}: this is the reading of all the best <abbr>MSS.</abbr>, and it is sufficiently supported by the parallel of <span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span>. 124, {psukhen ouk akros}. Most Editors however have adopted the reading {orgen akros}, as equivalent to {akrakholos}, “quick-tempered.”</p>
				<p>88 It has been suggested by some that this clause is not genuine. It should not, however, be taken to refer to the battle which was interrupted by the eclipse, for (1) that did not occur in the period here spoken of; (2) the next clause is introduced by {de} (which can hardly here stand for {gar}); (3) when the eclipse occurred the fighting ceased, therefore it was no more a {nuktomakhin} than any other battle which is interrupted by darkness coming on.</p>
				<p>89 See ch. 188. <i>Nabunita</i> was his true name.</p>
				<p>90 See ch. 107 <abbr>ff.</abbr></p>
				<p>91 Not “somewhere near the city of Sinope,” for it must have been at a considerable distance and probably far inland. Sinope itself is at least fifty miles to the west of the Halys. I take it to mean that Pteria was nearly due south of Sinope, <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr> that the nearest road from Pteria to the sea led to Sinope. Pteria no doubt was the name of a region as well as of a city.</p>
				<p>92 {anastatous epoiese}.</p>
				<p>93 This is the son of the man mentioned in ch. 74.</p>
				<p>94 {us en autou xeinikos}. Stein translates “so much of it as was mercenary,” but it may be doubted if this is possible. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Woods, “which army of his was a foreign one.”</p>
				<p>95 {Metros Dindumenes}, <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr> Kybele: the mountain is Dindymos in Phrygia.</p>
				<p>96 <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr> the whole strip of territory to the West of the peninsula of Argolis, which includes Thyrea and extends southwards to Malea: “westwards as far as Malea” would be absurd.</p>
				<p>97 {outos}: a conjectural emendation of {autos}.</p>
				<p>98 {autos}: some <abbr>MSS.</abbr> read {o autos}, “this same man.”</p>
				<p>99 {aneneikamenon}, nearly equivalent to {anastemaxanta} (cp. Hom. Il. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">xix</span>. 314), {mnesamenos d’ adinos aneneikato phonesen te}. Some translate it here, “he recovered himself,” cp. ch. 116, {aneneikhtheis}.</p>
				<p>100 {ubristai}.</p>
				<p>101 {proesousi}: a conjectural emendation of {poiesousi}, adopted in most of the modern editions.</p>
				<p>102 {touto oneidisai}: or {touton oneidisai}, “to reproach the god with these things.” The best <abbr>MSS.</abbr> have {touto}.</p>
				<p>103 {to kai⁠ ⁠… eipe ta eipe Loxias k.t.l.}: various emendations have been proposed. If anyone is to be adopted, the boldest would perhaps be the best, {to de kai⁠ ⁠… eipe Loxias}.</p>
				<p>104 {oia te kai alle khore}, “such as other lands have.”</p>
				<p>105 {stadioi ex kai duo plethra}.</p>
				<p>106 {plethra tria kai deka}.</p>
				<p>107 {Gugaie}.</p>
				<p>108 Or “Tyrrhenia.”</p>
				<p>109 Or “Umbrians.”</p>
				<p>110 {tes ano ‘Asies}, <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr> the parts which are removed from the Mediterranean.</p>
				<p>111 <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr> nature would not be likely to supply so many regularly ascending circles. Stein alters the text so that the sentence runs thus, “and whereas there are seven circles of all, within the last is the royal palace,” <abbr>etc.</abbr></p>
				<p>112 <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr> “to laugh or to spit is unseemly for those in presence of the king, and this last for all, whether in the presence of the king or not.” Cp. Xen. Cyrop. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span>. 2. 16, {aiskhron men gar eti kai nun esti Persais kai to apoptuein kai to apomuttesthai}, (quoted by Stein, who however gives a different interpretation).</p>
				<p>113 {tauta de peri eouton esemnune}: the translation given is that of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Woods.</p>
				<p>114 {allos mentoi eouton eu ekontes}: the translation is partly due to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Woods.</p>
				<p>115 <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr> East of the Halys: see note on ch. 95.</p>

				<p>117 Cp. ch. 72.</p>
				<p>118 {ten katuperthe odon}, <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr> further away from the Euxine eastwards.</p>
				<p>119 {o theos}.</p>
				<p>120 {khoris men gar phoron}: many Editors substitute {phoron} for {phoron}, but {phoron} may stand if taken not with {khoris} but with {to ekastoisi epeballon}.</p>
				<p>121 Cp. ch. 184, “the Assyrian history.”</p>
				<p>122 {uperthemenos}, a conjectural emendation of {upothemenos}, cp. ch. 108 where the <abbr>MSS.</abbr> give {uperthemenos}, (the Medicean with {upo} written above as a correction).</p>
				<p>123 Or “expose me to risk,” “stake my safety.”</p>
				<p>124 Or “thou wilt suffer the most evil kind of death”: cp. ch. 167.</p>
				<p>12401 {tas aggelias pherein}, <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr> to have the office of {aggeliephoros} (ch. 120) or {esaggeleus} (<span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span>. 84), the chamberlain through whom communications passed.</p>
				<p>125 {dialabein}. So translated by <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Woods.</p>
				<p>126 {es tas anagkas}, “to the necessity,” mentioned above.</p>
				<p>127 Or “to celebrate good fortune.”</p>

				<p>129 {esti te o pais kai periesti}. So translated by <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Woods.</p>
				<p>130 {erkhe}: a few inferior <abbr>MSS.</abbr> have {eikhe}, which is adopted by several Editors.</p>
				<p>131 {para smikra⁠ ⁠… kekhoreke}, “have come out equal to trifles.”</p>
				<p>132 {kuon}: cp. ch. 110.</p>
				<p>133 {su nun}, answering to {se gar theoi eporeousi}: the <abbr>MSS.</abbr> and some Editors read {su nun}.</p>
				<p>134 <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr> of the race of Perses: see <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VII</span>. 61.</p>
				<p>135 “how his change from a throne to slavery was as compared with that feast, <abbr>etc.</abbr>,” <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr> what did he think of it as a retribution.</p>
				<p>136 See ch. 106. The actual duration of the Median supremacy would be therefore a hundred years.</p>
				<p>13601 This is by some altered to “Alilat,” by comparison of <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span>. 8.</p>

				<p>140 {proskuneei}, <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr> kisses his feet or the ground.</p>
				<p>141 {ton legomenon}, a correction of {to legomeno}. (The Medicean <abbr>MS.</abbr> has {toi legomenoi} like the rest, not {toi legomeno}, as stated by Stein.)</p>
				<p>142 {ekhomenon, kata ton auton de logon}: the <abbr>MSS.</abbr> and most Editors have {ekhomenon}. {kata ton auton de logon}; “and this same rule the Persians observe in giving honour.” This, however, makes it difficult (though not impossible) to refer {to ethnos} in the next clause to the Medes, and it can hardly be referred to the Persians, who certainly had not the same system of government.

				<p>143 Cp. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VII</span>. 194.</p>
				<p>144 {polloi}: omitted, or corrected variously, by Editors. There is, perhaps, something wrong about the text in the next clause also, for it seems clear that white doves were not objected to by the Persians. See Stein’s note.</p>
				<p>145 See ch. 95.</p>
				<p>146 These words, “neither those towards the East nor those towards the West” have perhaps been interpolated as an explanation of {ta ano} and {ta kato}. As an explanation they can hardly be correct, but the whole passage is vaguely expressed.</p>

				<p>167 {Karkhedonioi}.</p>
				<p>168 {elakhon te auton pollo pleious}. Several Editors suppose that words have been lost or that the text is corrupt. I understand it to mean that many more of them fell into the hands of the enemy than were rescued by their own side. Some translate “divided most of them by lot”; but this would be {dielakhon}, and the proceeding would have no object if the prisoners were to be put to death at once. For {pleious} Stein reads {pleistous}.</p>

				<p>190 {oligon ti parateinousa apo tou potamou}.</p>
				<p>191 {ou gar ameinon}, an Epic phrase, cp. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span>. 71 and 82.</p>
				<p>192 {eskeuasmenos}, a conjectural emendation of {eskeuasmenoisi}, “with provisions well prepared.”</p>
				<p>193 {kateteine skhoinoteneas upodexas diorukhas}. Stein understands {kateteine ten stratien} (resumed afterwards by {diataxas}), “he extended his army, having first marked out channels straight by lines.”</p>
				<p>194 {proesaxanto}, from {proesago}: it may be however from {prosatto}, “they had heaped together provisions for themselves beforehand.”</p>
				<p>195 {ten stratien apasan}. Stein thinks that some correction is needed.</p>
				<p>196 {oi d’ an perudontes k.t.l.}: the <abbr>MSS.</abbr> have {oud’ an perudontes}, “they would not even have allowed them to enter the city (from the river),” but the negative is awkward referring to the participle alone, and the admission of the enemy to the riverbed within the city would have been an essential part of the scheme, not to be omitted in the description.</p>
				<p>197 The Attic <i>medimnos</i> (= 48 <i>choinikes</i>) was rather less than 12 gallons.</p>
				<p>198 {ton tes Demetros karpon}.</p>
				<p>199 Stein supposes that words have fallen out before {ta gar de alla dendrea}, chiefly because some mention of the palm-trees might have been expected here.</p>
				<p>200 {phoinikeious}: some Editors (following Valla) have altered this to {phoinikeiou} (“casks of palm-wine”), but it is not likely that palm-wine would have been thus imported, see ch. 193.</p>
				<p>201 {kai o men eso elkei to plektron o de exo otheei}. I take it to mean that there is one steering-oar on each side, and the “inside” is the side nearer to the bank of the river. The current would naturally run faster on the “outside” and consequently would tend to turn the boat round, and therefore the inside oarsman pulls his oar constantly towards himself and the outside man pushes his oar from himself (<abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr> backs water), to keep the boat straight. Various explanations are given. Stein takes {eso, exo} with the verbs, “one draws the boat towards himself, the other pushes it from himself.” <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Woods understands that only one oar is used at a time and by two men looking different ways, of whom {o men eso} is he who stands nearest to the side of the boat.</p>
				<p>202 If the talents meant are Euboic, this would be about 170 tons.</p>
				<p>203 {mitresi}: cp. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VII</span>. 62.</p>
				<p>204 {os an ai parthenoi ginoiato}, equivalent to {osai aei parthenoi ginoiato}, which Stein suggests as a correction.</p>
				<p>205 This sentence, “in order that⁠—city,” is thought by Stein to be either interpolated or misplaced.</p>
				<p>206 {katestekee}: some Editors adopt the correction {katesteke}, “is established.”</p>
				<p>207 {iron}, afterwards called {temenos}.</p>
				<p>208 {panta tropon odon}: some <abbr>MSS.</abbr> have {odon} for {odon}, and {odon ekhousi} might perhaps mean “afford a passage.” (The reading of the Medicean <abbr>MS.</abbr> is {odon}.)</p>
				<p>209 “I call upon Mylitta against thee”; or perhaps, “I call upon Mylitta to be favourable to thee.”</p>
				<p>210 {aposiosamene te theo}.</p>
				<p>211 {eideos te epammenai eisi kai megatheos}.</p>
				<p>212 {patriai}.</p>
				<p>213 {antion}.</p>
				<p>214 That is perhaps, “if one rows as well as sails,” using oars when the wind is not favourable, cp. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span>. 11.</p>
				<p>215 {genomene}, or {ginomene}, “which he met with.”</p>
				<p>216 {eonta akharita}: most of the <abbr>MSS.</abbr> have {ta eonta akharita}, with which reading the sentence would be, “the sufferings which I have, have proved bitter lessons of wisdom to me.”</p>
				<p>217 {me eie}.</p>
				<p>218 {tou katharou stratou}, perhaps “the effective part,” without the encumbrances, cp. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span>. 135.</p>

				<p>222 {thuousi}.</p>
				<p>223 {nomos}: the conjecture {noos}, “meaning,” which is adopted by many Editors, may be right; but {nomos} seems to mean the “customary rule” which determines this form of sacrifice, the rule namely of “swift to the swift.”</p>

				<p>25 The meaning seems to be this: “The Ionians say that Egypt is the Delta, and at the same time they divide the world into three parts, Europe, Asia, and Libya, the last two being divided from one another by the Nile. Thus they have left out Egypt altogether; and either they must add the Delta as a fourth part of the world, or they must give up the Nile as a boundary. If the name Egypt be extended, as it is by the other Hellenes, to the upper course of the Nile, it is then possible to retain the Nile as a boundary, saying that half of Egypt belongs to Asia and half to Libya, and disregarding the Delta (ch. 17). This also would be an error of reckoning, but less serious than to omit Egypt together.” The reasoning is obscure because it alludes to theories (of Hecataios and other writers) which are presumed to be already known to the reader.</p>

				<p>135 I understand that each wall consisted of a single stone, which gave the dimensions each way: “as regards height and length” therefore it was made of a single stone. That it should have been a monolith, except the roof, is almost impossible, not only because of the size mentioned (which in any case is suspicious), but because no one would so hollow out a monolith that it would be necessary afterwards to put on another stone for the roof. The monolith chamber mentioned in ch. 175, which it took three years to convey from Elephantine, measured only 21 cubits by 14 by 8. The {parorophis} or “cornice” is not an “eave projecting four cubits,” but (as the word is explained by Pollux) a cornice between ceiling and roof, measuring in this instance four cubits in height and formed by the thickness of the single stone: see Letronne, Recherches pour servir, <abbr>etc.</abbr> <abbr>p.</abbr> 80 (quoted by Bähr).</p>

				<p>1 {ie paion} (or {paian}), as the burden of a song of triumph.</p>
				<p>2 {eggenetai}: many <abbr>MSS.</abbr> and some Editors read {en genetai}, “and the race can never become united.”</p>
				<p>3 <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span>. 93.</p>
				<p>301 Or “from the time that he was born.”</p>
				<p>4 {to astikton} is probably for {to me estikhthai}: but possibly the meaning may be, “those who are not so marked are of low birth.”</p>
				<p>5 “the greatest prizes are assigned for single combat in proportion” (as it is more difficult).</p>
				<p>6 Or “Siriopaionians.”</p>
				<p>7 The words “and about the Doberians and Agrianians and Odomantians” are marked by Stein as an interpolation, on the ground that the two tribes first mentioned are themselves Paionian; but Doberians are distinguished from Paionians in <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VII</span>. 113.</p>
				<p>8 {theres katarraktes}: the <abbr>MSS.</abbr> have {thures katapaktes} (which can hardly be right, since the Ionic form would be {katapektes}), meaning “fastened down.” Stein suggests {thures katepaktes} (from {katepago}), which might mean “a door closed downwards,” but the word is not found. (The Medicean <abbr>MS.</abbr> has {e} written over the last {a} of {katapaktes}.)</p>
				<p>9 {diapinontes}: or perhaps, “drinking against one another.”</p>
				<p>10 See <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VIII</span>. 137.</p>
				<p>11 <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr> “he was drawn to run in the first pair.”</p>
				<p>12 The best <abbr>MSS.</abbr> give this form throughout, which is also used by Aeschylus: cp. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span>. 70, note 60.</p>
				<p>13 {ekakothesan}.</p>
				<p>14 {toutou}: it is doubtful whether this means his power or his death. Perhaps something has dropped out after {teleuta}.</p>
				<p>15 {anesis}: a conjectural emendation of {aneos}. (Perhaps however, the word was rather {ananeosis}, “after a short time there was a renewal of evils”). Grote wishes to translate this clause, “after a short time there was an abatement of evils,” being of opinion that the {anesis kakon} lasted about eight years. However the expression {ou pollon khronon} is so loose that it might well cover the required period of time.</p>
				<p>16 {praskhema}.</p>
				<p>17 <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr> Miletos and Naxos.</p>
				<p>18 {ton pakheon}.</p>
				<p>1801 {umin}: omitted in some <abbr>MSS.</abbr> and editions.</p>
				<p>19 Lit. “dividing him in such a manner.”</p>
				<p>20 {kai to teikhos esaxanto}: {esaxanto} from {satto}, which generally means “load.” Various conjectures have been made, <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">e.g.</abbr> {kai to teikhos ephraxanto}, or {kata takhos esaxanto}, the comma after {pota} being removed.</p>
				<p>2001 {me de neoteron ti poieuses tes Miletou}, “if Miletos made no change (<abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr> rebellion).”</p>
				<p>21 {katairetheie}, “taken down” from their place (cp. {anetheke} below).</p>
				<p>22 {en to peoto ton logon}. The reference is to <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span>. 92.</p>
				<p>23 {isonomien}: cp. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span>. 80.</p>
				<p>24 {akromantes}: cp. {akrakholos}. It may mean “somewhat mad,” so {akrozumos}, “slightly leavened,” and other words.</p>
				<p>25 {Kinupa}: for this Stein reads by conjecture {Aibuen} and afterwards {para Kinupa potamon} for {para potamon}: but Kinyps was the name of the district about the river (<span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span>. 198), and the name of the river is easily supplied from this.</p>
				<p>26 {Makeon te kai Libuon}. The Macai were of course Libyans, therefore perhaps we should read (with Niebuhr) {Makeon te Libuon}: or {Makeon te kai allon Libuon}.</p>
				<p>27 Stein thinks that Heracleia Minoa on the S. coast of Sicily cannot be meant, because too distant to be considered part of the “land of Eryx.” Evidently however this expression is very vague, and there seems no need to correct the text as he proposes.</p>
				<p>28 {para ten Italion}: the name applied anciently only to the Southwest of the peninsula.</p>
				<p>29 {Krathin}, the <abbr>MSS.</abbr> give {krastin} here, and {krastie} below for {Krathie}. Sybaris was situated between the rivers Crathis and Sybaris.</p>
				<p>30 <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr> “of the Marketplace.”</p>
				<p>31 {periodos}.</p>
				<p>32 {kurbasias}: see <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VII</span>. 64.</p>
				<p>33 {poluargurotatoi}: this seems to include gold also, for which Lydia was famous.</p>
				<p>34 {poluprobatotatoi}.</p>
				<p>35 {tende}, pointing to it in the map.</p>
				<p>36 If {anaballesthai} is the true reading here, it cannot mean, “put off to another time,” as Stein translates it; for the form of the sentence proves that it is to be taken as a question, coordinate with that which follows: {peri men khores ara ou polles khreon esti umeas makhas anaballesthai, parekhon de tes Asies arkhein allo ti airesesthe}; the first clause being in sense subordinate to the second.</p>
				<p>37 {es triten emeren}.</p>
				<p>38 {diaphthereei se}. It is impossible to reproduce the double meaning of {diaphtheirein}, “to destroy,” and “to corrupt with bribes.” The child was apparently alarmed by the vehement gestures of Aristagoras and supposed that he was going to kill her father. Cleomenes accepts the omen.</p>
				<p>39 {stathmoi}: “stations,” the distance between them averaging here about 120 stades.</p>
				<p>40 {parasaggai}: the “parasang,” as estimated at 30 stades, would be nearly 3½ English miles.</p>
				<p>4001 <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr> a narrow pass; so also below in speaking of the passes into Kilikia.</p>
				<p>41 In the <abbr>MSS.</abbr> this clause follows the account of the four rivers, and the distance through Matiene is given as “four stages” with no number of leagues added. By transposing the clause we avoid placing the rivers in Armenia instead of Matiene; and by making the number of stages thirty-four, with a corresponding number of leagues, we make the total right at the end and give the proper extension to Matiene.</p>
				<p>42 <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr> Zabatos: the name has perhaps fallen out of the text.</p>
				<p>43 {o d’ usteron}: “the one mentioned afterwards.” Stein reads {o d’ usteros}.</p>
				<p>44 See <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span>. 189.</p>
				<p>45 {parasagges}.</p>
				<p>46 {stadia}: the stade being equal to 606¾ English feet.</p>
				<p>47 Reckoned for the march of an army.</p>
				<p>48 Omitting {to eoutou pathei} which stands in the <abbr>MSS.</abbr> before {enargestaten}. If the words are retained, we must translate “which clearly pointed to his fate.”</p>
				<p>49 {apeipamenos ten opsin}, which some translate “he made offerings to avert the dream.”</p>
				<p>4901 {tisi}: many Editors adopt the conjecture {trisi}, three.</p>
				<p>50 {anetheken eon}: various conjectures have been made here, <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">e.g.</abbr> {anetheken elon}, {anetheken ion}, {anetheke theo}, {anetheken eont}, {anetheke neon}: the last, which is Bentley’s, is perhaps the best; but it is doubtful whether the active form of the verb is admissible.</p>
				<p>51 {autos}: the <abbr>MSS.</abbr> have {auton}. If {autos} is right, the meaning is “from his own property.”</p>
				<p>52 The expression {Peisistratidai} is used loosely for the family in general.</p>
				<p>53 {porinou lithou}, “tufa.”</p>
				<p>5301 Or “of God.”</p>
				<p>54 {Koniaion}. There is no such place as Conion known in Thessaly, but we cannot correct the text with any certainty.</p>
				<p>55 There is perhaps a play of words in {basileus} and {leuster}.</p>
				<p>56 {prutaneio}.</p>
				<p>57 “Rulers of the people.”</p>
				<p>58 “Swine-ites.”</p>
				<p>59 “Ass-ites.”</p>
				<p>60 “Pig-ites.”</p>
				<p>61 {proteron aposmenon, tote panta}: most of the <abbr>MSS.</abbr> read {panton} for {panta}. The Editors propose various corrections, <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">e.g.</abbr> {proteron apospenon panton, tote k.t.l.}, “which before were excluded from everything,” or {proteron apospenon, tote panton metadidous}, “giving the people, which before he had despised, a share of all rights”: or {panton} is corrected to {epanion}, “on his return from exile,” temporary exile being supposed as the result of the defeat mentioned in ch. 66.</p>
				<p>62 {tous enageas}.</p>
				<p>63 <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr> of Athene Polias in the Erechtheion.</p>
				<p>64 Cp. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span>. 145.</p>
				<p>6401 {tous boethous}: most of the <abbr>MSS.</abbr> have {tous Boiotous}.</p>
				<p>65 {ippobotai}.</p>
				<p>66 {dimneos apotimesamenoi}.</p>
				<p>67 See <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VIII</span>. 53.</p>
				<p>68 {isegorin}: probably not “equal freedom of speech,” but practically the same as {isonomie}, ch. 37.</p>
				<p>69 Lit. “penetrated the Athenian greatly”: most <abbr>MSS.</abbr> and Editors read {esineonto} (or {esinonto}) for {esikneonto}, which is given by the first hand in at least two good <abbr>MSS.</abbr></p>
				<p>70 <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr> “Athene (protectress) of the city,” who shared with Erechtheus the temple on the Acropolis called the “Erechtheion”; see <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VIII</span>. 55.</p>
				<p>71 More lit. “to give and receive from one another satisfaction.”</p>
				<p>72 {eti tode poiesai nomon einai, para sphisi ekateroisi k.t.l.} The Editors punctuate variously, and alterations have been proposed in the text.</p>
				<p>73 <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr> Damia and Auxesia.</p>
				<p>74 {ginoito}: some <abbr>MSS.</abbr> read {an ginoito}, “would become”: so Stein and many other Editors.</p>
				<p>75 Some Editors omit this clause, “whither⁠—refuge.”</p>
				<p>76 “having grown a good opinion of itself.”</p>
				<p>7601 Or, altering {oste} to {os ge} or {osper}, “as the neighbours of these men first of all, that is the Boeotians and Chalkidians, have already learnt, and perhaps some others will afterwards learn that they have committed an error.” The word {amarton} would thus be added as an afterthought, with reference primarily to the Corinthians, see ch. 75.</p>
				<p>77 {peiresometha spheas ama umin apikomenoi tisasthai}: some <abbr>MSS.</abbr> read {akeomenoi} and omit {tisasthai}. Hence it has been proposed to read {peisesometha sphea ama umin akeomenoi}, “we will endeavour to remedy this with your help,” which may be right.</p>
				<p>78 So the name is given by the better class of <abbr>MSS.</abbr> Others, followed by most Editors, make it “Sosicles.”</p>
				<p>79 {isokratias}.</p>
				<p>80 Lit. “gave and took (in marriage) from one another.”</p>
				<p>81 {Eetion, outis se tiei polutiton eonta}: the play upon {Eetion} and {tio} can hardly be rendered. The “rolling rock” in the next line is an allusion to Petra, the name of the deme.</p>
				<p>82 {aietos en petresi kuei}, with a play upon the names {Eetion} ({Aeton}) and {Petre} again.</p>
				<p>83 {ophruoenta}, “situated on a brow or edge,” the regular descriptive epithet of Corinth.</p>
				<p>84 {kupselen}: cp. Aristoph. Pax, 631.</p>
				<p>85 {amphidection}: commonly translated “ambiguous,” but in fact the oracle is of the clearest, so much so that Abicht cuts the knot by inserting {ouk}. Stein explains it to mean “doubly favourable,” {amphoterothen dection}. I understand it to mean “two-edged” (cp. {amphekes}), in the sense that while promising success to Kypselos and his sons, it prophesies also the deposition of the family in the generation after, and so acts (or cuts) both ways.</p>
				<p>86 {anapodizon}, “calling him back over the same ground again.”</p>
				<p>87 Evidently the war must be dated earlier than the time of Peisistratos.</p>
				<p>8701 Or (according to some <abbr>MSS.</abbr>), “another of the citizens, named Hermophantos.”</p>
				<p>88 {tes sulloges oste tauta sunuphanthenai}, “the assembling together so that these things were woven.”</p>
				<p>89 {kai allos lematos pleos}.</p>
				<p>90 {plospheresteron}, or perhaps {plopheresteron}, “to be preferred”; so one <abbr>MS.</abbr>: {plospheres} ordinarily means “like.”</p>
				<p>91 {drepano}, cp. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VII</span>. 93.</p>
				<p>92 {delade}, ironical.</p>

				<p>94 <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr> Carians, Persians, and Ionians.</p>

				<p>34 The meaning is much disputed. I understand Herodotus to state that though the vessels lay of course in the direction of the stream from the Hellespont, that is presenting their prows (or sterns) to the stream, yet this did not mean that they pointed straight towards the Propontis and Euxine; for the stream after passing Sestos runs almost from North to South with even a slight tendency to the East (hence {eurou} a few lines further on), so that ships lying in the stream would point in a line cutting at right angles that of the longer axis (from East to West) of the Pontus and Propontis. This is the meaning of {epikarsios} elsewhere in Herodotus (<span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span>. 180 and <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span>. 101), and it would be rash to assign to it any other meaning here. It is true however that the expression {pros esperes} is used loosely below for the side toward the Egean. For {anakokheue} a subject must probably be supplied from the clause {pentekonterous⁠—sunthentes}, “that it (<abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr> the combination of ships) might support <abbr>etc.</abbr>,” and {ton tonon ton oplon} may either mean as below “the stretched ropes,” or “the tension of the ropes,” which would be relieved by the support: the latter meaning seems to me preferable.</p>
				<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Whitelaw suggests to me that {epikarsios} ({epi kar}) may mean rather “head-foremost,” which seems to be its meaning in Homer (Odyss. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IX</span>. 70), and from which might be obtained the idea of intersection, one line running straight up against another, which it has in other passages. In that case it would here mean “heading towards the Pontus.”]</p>

Probably in this passage the idea is rather of the prows projecting in rows like battlements {krossai}, and this is the sense in which the word is used by Herodotus elsewhere (<span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span>. 152). The word {krossai} however is used for the successively rising stages of the pyramids (<span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span>. 125), and {prokrossos} may mean simply “in a row,” or “one behind the other,” which would suit all passages in which it occurs, and would explain the expression {prokrossoi pheromenoi epi ton kindunon}, quoted by Athenæus.</p>

				<p>88 Most of the commentators (and following them the historians) understand the imperfect {ediokon} to express the mere purpose to attempt, and suppose that this purpose was actually hindered by the Lacedemonians, but for a mere half-formed purpose the expression {mekhri Thessalies} seems to definite, and Diodorus states that Artabazos was pursued. I think therefore that Krüger is right in understanding {eon} of an attempt to dissuade which was not successful. The alternative version would be “they were for pursuing them as far as Thessaly, but the Lacedemonians prevented them from pursuing fugitives.”</p>
